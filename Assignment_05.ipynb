    "1.Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",

    "2.A single class can have multiple superclasses, each of which contributes to its attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.This allows for greater code reuse and flexibility in building complex class hierarchies, as classes can be composed from a combination of existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.It can also lead to conflicts and ambiguity, as methods or attributes with the same name may be inherited from different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.To address this, programming languages typically provide mechanisms for resolving conflicts, such as specifying which superclass takes precedence or using aliasing.\n",
