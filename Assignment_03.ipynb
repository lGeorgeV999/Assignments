    "In object-oriented programming, an abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes. An abstract superclass defines common behaviors and properties that are shared by its subclasses, but it cannot be directly instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key characteristic of an abstract superclass is that it contains one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "Abstract methods are method declarations that do not contain a body, meaning that they do not have an implementation. Instead, they are designed to be overridden by subclasses that inherit from the abstract superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining abstract methods in an abstract superclass, you can ensure that its subclasses implement certain behaviors, while also allowing each subclass to provide its own implementation. This allows you to define a common interface for a group of related classes, while still allowing each class to be customized to its own specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an abstract superclass, you must first create a subclass that extends the abstract class. The subclass must implement all of the abstract methods defined in the superclass, as well as any additional methods or properties that are specific to the subclass. This creates a hierarchical class structure, where the abstract superclass defines a set of behaviors that are inherited by its subclasses, which can then be further customized as needed.\n",
