    "The main difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is their behavior when accessing attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__ is called when an attribute is not found using the usual attribute lookup. It is a fallback method that allows you to define custom behavior for attribute access. If an attribute is not found, __getattr__ is invoked and can provide a value for the attribute or raise an AttributeError if the attribute is truly undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__, on the other hand, is called for every attribute access, whether the attribute exists or not. It is a more general method that intercepts all attribute access and allows you to customize the behavior completely. You can use __getattribute__ to dynamically compute or transform attribute values, control access to attributes, or raise exceptions based on attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__ is invoked only when an attribute is not found using the usual lookup mechanism.\n",
    "__getattribute__ is called for every attribute access and allows complete control over attribute access.\n",
    "It's important to note that __getattribute__ can be powerful but also dangerous if not used carefully, as it can create infinite recursion if you're not careful to delegate attribute lookups appropriately."

They are defined using the @property decorator and allow you to define methods for getting, setting, and deleting attribute values.\n",

    "Descriptors, on the other hand, provide a lower-level mechanism for controlling attribute access. They are defined by creating classes that implement the descriptor protocol, which involves defining __get__, __set__, and __delete__ methods.
