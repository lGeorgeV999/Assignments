    "The main difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is their behavior when accessing attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__ is called when an attribute is not found using the usual attribute lookup. It is a fallback method that allows you to define custom behavior for attribute access. If an attribute is not found, __getattr__ is invoked and can provide a value for the attribute or raise an AttributeError if the attribute is truly undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__, on the other hand, is called for every attribute access, whether the attribute exists or not. It is a more general method that intercepts all attribute access and allows you to customize the behavior completely. You can use __getattribute__ to dynamically compute or transform attribute values, control access to attributes, or raise exceptions based on attribute access.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__ is invoked only when an attribute is not found using the usual lookup mechanism.\n",
    "__getattribute__ is called for every attribute access and allows complete control over attribute access.\n",
    "It's important to note that __getattribute__ can be powerful but also dangerous if not used carefully, as it can create infinite recursion if you're not careful to delegate attribute lookups appropriately."

    "\n",
    "Properties are a convenient way to manage attribute access and provide additional functionality, such as data validation or computed values, while maintaining a simple syntax. They are defined using the @property decorator and allow you to define methods for getting, setting, and deleting attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors, on the other hand, provide a lower-level mechanism for controlling attribute access. They are defined by creating classes that implement the descriptor protocol, which involves defining __get__, __set__, and __delete__ methods. Descriptors allow you to customize attribute access at a more granular level, enabling fine-grained control over how attributes are retrieved, set, and deleted.\n",

    "Properties provide a more convenient and readable syntax for most attribute access scenarios, while descriptors offer greater flexibility and control for advanced use cases."
