    "The two most popular variations of the try statement in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "try-except block: This is the most commonly used variation of the try statement. In this variation, you specify a block of code that may raise an exception, and then specify one or more except blocks to handle the exception if it occurs. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # handle SomeException\n",
    "except AnotherException:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    # code to be executed if no exception is raised\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # code to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "In this example, the try block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the except blocks specify how to handle specific exceptions that may be raised. The else block is optional, and contains code to be executed if no exception is raised. The finally block is also optional, and contains code to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "try-finally block: This variation of the try statement is used when you need to ensure that a block of code is executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. In this variation, you specify a block of code that may raise an exception, and a finally block that contains the code to be executed at termination time. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # code to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not\n",
    "In this example, the try block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the finally block contains the code to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This variation of the try statement is useful for performing cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, that must be done regardless of whether an exception occurred or not."
